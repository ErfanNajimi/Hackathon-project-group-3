# Cyber Safety - Staying Safe Online

## Project overview

Cyber security is something everyone who uses the internet needs to think about and find the information they need to protect themselves and loved ones from harm. This website is an attractive hub of awareness, via secure information, handy tips, external resources and blog posts suitable for all ages.

## User Experience Design (UX)

The site is of minimalist and consistent design over all pages, providing the user with ease of use, along with information regarding cyber safety, extra resources and a choice to subscribe to the Cyber Safety newsletter.

Through the application of agile methodologies, we started out with wireframes and discussed ideas, before we settled on one style and expanded upon that with frames for mobile, tablet and desktop.

User stories were created and put into our Product Backlog Kanban board on Github, so we could monitor our progress and be clear about our assignments.

[Include some user stories?]


## Features 

-__Navigation bar__

At the top of every page within the site, the full responsive navigation bar includes the Cyber Safety logo and links to all pages on the site. Namely ‘Home’, ‘Guide’, ‘Resources’, ‘Newsletter’ and ‘Blog’. This provides ease of navigation for the user and a pleasing consistency in the design of the site.

--------------- code institute notes -------- to be removed --------
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing 

---------------- code institute notes --------------
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
 
--------------------------

### Unfixed Bugs

------------ code institute notes
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
-----------------------
